ObixModel has request XML hardcoded.
requestXML:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<obj href="obix:HistoryFilter" xmlns="http://obix.org/ns/schema/1.0">
	<int name="limit" null="true"/>
	<abstime name="start" val="'+start+'"/>
	<abstime name="end" null="true"/>
</obj>

start is currently set in ObixModel:
let start = moment().subtract(3600, 'seconds').format();
which is measurements for the latest hour.
and since Obix REST-API gives one sample for 5 second interval => 12 samples per minute => 720 samples per hour.



In backend we have implemented a proxy cache in Mongo database.
Each request is stored as key (=request), value (=response) pairs and stored into database. 
nd served from the cache or asked again from the 
http://localhost:3000/proxes/obix/

A POST method is used to send request XML with authorization and expiration_in_seconds to backend service.
